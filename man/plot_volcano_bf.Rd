\title{Volcano plot for Bayes factor results}
\usage{
plot_volcano_bf(results, comparison = NULL, bf_threshold = 3, fc_threshold = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A pepdiff_results object from bayes_t test}

\item{comparison}{Optional comparison name to filter by}

\item{bf_threshold}{BF threshold for coloring (default 3)}

\item{fc_threshold}{Fold change threshold for labeling (default 1)}
}
\value{
A ggplot object
}
\description{
Creates a volcano plot with log10(BF) on the y-axis instead of -log10(p-value).
Reference lines are drawn at BF thresholds (3, 10) and their reciprocals (0.33, 0.1).
